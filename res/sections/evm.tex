\subsection{Ethereum Virtual Machine}
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (\textbf{EVM}) is an abstract computing machine
that enables the nodes of the Ethereum network to execute smart-contract
codes.
The EVM's specification and the description of all the byte-code instructions
are contained in the yellow paper~\cite{wood2018ethereum}. 
Like the JVM, the EVM is a stack-based machine. 
The word size and the stack item size are $256$--bit\footnote{The motivation
for this choice is to facilitate the Keccak-256 hash scheme and elliptic
curve computation that are pervasive in Ethereum.},
and the stack capacity is $1024$.
The EVM memory consists of a simple byte array and exists only during the
execution. The storage is a key value hash table that is persistent and is
part of the state of the contract account. The program is stored on the
blockchain and can therefore not be modified\footnote{There exists
techniques to provide new version updates as explained
here:
