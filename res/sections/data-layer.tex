\subsection{Data layer}

In the Network and Propagation layers, we formed the network and we defined how
the data is disseminated. Now, we need to define which data to propagate. The
Data layer consists of the data structures and the data types that are present
in the Ethereum system. With the term \emph{data types}, we mainly mean the
abstract data types which identify the common Ethereum objects, such as the
state, the accounts, and the transactions.
