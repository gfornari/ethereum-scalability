\subsection{Data layer}

In the previous layers, we formed the network and we defined how the data is
disseminated on it. Now, we need to define which data to propagate. The Data
layer consist of the data structures and the data types that are present in the
Ethereum system. With the term \emph{data types}, we mainly mean the abstract
data types which identify the common Ethereum objects, such as the state, the
accounts, and the transactions.
