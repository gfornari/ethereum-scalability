\subsection{State}

We can distinguish two different states in the Ethereum system:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the \textbf{World State}, referred simply as the \emph{state}, which is
  a mapping between account addresses and account states (i.e. the blockchain)
  \item the \textbf{Machine State}, the state of an Ethereum Virtual Machine
  (EVM) (see ??)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Accounts}

There are two types of accounts:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the \textbf{non-contract account}
  \item the \textbf{contract account}, which has EVM Code associated with it and
  is controlled by its contract code
\end{itemize}

A \emph{non-contract account} has no EVM Code associated with it and is
controlled by a private key. This type of account can send a message to another
non-contract account, that is a value transfer, or to a contract account in
order to trigger the execution of code.

A \emph{contract account} has EVM Code associated with it and is controlled by
it. This type of account cannot send messages on its own, but can only create
transactions as a response to a trigger.
