\subsubsection{RLPx Transport Protocol}
\label{sec:rlpx-transport-protocol}

The aim of this protocol is to provide a transport layer for the messages. In
essence, it is an encrypted and authenticated TCP with payload encoded with the
Recursive Length Prefix (\textbf{RLP}) marshaling algorithm. Two peers who wants
to communicate with each other with RLPx should as a first step perform a
handshake, in which they exchange a cryptographic secret\footnote{It is beyond
the scope of this report to describe the exact procedure. For further details we
refer to the official documentation \cite{rlpx} and to the go ethereum
implementation
\url{https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/p2p/rlpx.go}.},
that is used to encrypt and authenticate the subsequent RLPx messages between
them.
