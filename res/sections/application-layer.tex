\subsection{Application layer}

So far we built the structure needed to communicate and agree on the state.
Ethereum offers an execution environment where code can be executed. This
enables the implementation of arbitrary business logic providing new
possibilities for a wide variety of applications.

The application layer comprises the smart contract, a collection of functions
able to modify the state and executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
