\subsection{Application layer}

So far we built the structure needed to communicate and agree on the state.
Ethereum proposes an execution environment where code can be executed. This
enables the implementation of arbitrary business logic opening possibilities
towards a wide variety of applications.

The application layer comprises the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) where the
code is executed, and the smart contract, a collection of functions able to
modify the state thanks to the EVM.
