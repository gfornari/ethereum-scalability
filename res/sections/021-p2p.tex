The peer-to-peer network underlying Ethereum is maintained by means of the 
RLPx and the devp2p-Wire protocols.
The former is used for the exchange of packets between the peers and theirs
discovery, while the latter makes it possible to participate to the 
blockchain's consensus. Clearly, the former exploits the latter.
