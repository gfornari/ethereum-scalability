\subsubsection{Y-Axis: Functional Decomposition}

The y-axis scaling focuses on the separation based on the responsibility for an
action which can be determined by the type of data or the type of work performed
for a transaction. While scaling on the x-axis could means "everyone does
everything", scaling on the y-axis specializes the workers splitting the whole
service in small services and assigning each service to a single worker. If we
combine the x-axis with the y-axis, we could have cluster of specialized workers
such that each cluster cover a different service, but workers in the same
cluster do the same job.

With regards to the data, differently from what happens in the x-axis, each
service should have its own non-shared data, thus segmenting it based on what
each service needs to have access to. This allows to size and optimize the
resources based on the transactions demand for each service, and ultimately
to reduce the operational costs.
