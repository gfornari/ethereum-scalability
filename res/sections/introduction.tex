\section*{Introduction}

The purpose of this report is to investigate the scalability of
Ethereum~\cite{wood2018ethereum}. Ethereum is based on the Blockchain
technology. The aim of this technology is to provide a total order of the 
transactions in a distributed ledger without relying on a trusted third party, 
e.g. a bank~\cite{bib:the-quest}. Not relying on a trusted central authority
may lead to some practical issues like the infamous \textbf{double-spending
problem} and the transaction repudiation. The latter problem is solved by the
digital signatures, while the latter remained unsolved until bitcoin appeared.
