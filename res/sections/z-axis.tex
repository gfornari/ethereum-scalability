\subsubsection{Z-Axis: Horizontal Data Partitioning}

The direction taken by scaling on the y-axis is to segment based on the service,
i.e. based on \emph{dissimilar} things. Scaling on the z-axis means segment on
\emph{similar} things, thus making the segmentation biased by the data or the
actions that are unique to the sender or the receiver of the request. An example
of such scaling could be, in a client-server architecture, the geographic
distribution of the servers based on the clients requests, such that a request
performed in Europe is undertaken by a server located in Europe instead of one
located on the other side of the globe.
