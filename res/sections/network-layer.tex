\subsection{Network layer}
\label{sec:network-layer}

The aim of this layer is to build the peer-to-peer network underlying Ethereum
and organize it into a \textbf{structured overlay network}, so that the nodes
of the network can propagate the information efficiently.
Essentially, this layer is constituted by a slight modification of the 
Kademlia protocol~\cite{bib:discovery-protocol}.
In the Ethereum jargon this protocol is known as \textbf{RLPx Node Discovery
Protocol}.

The Kademlia protocol is a distributed hash table (DHT) system
based on the XOR-metric for
distance~\cite{bib:kademlia}, i.e. the distance between two keys $x$ and $y$ is 
given by $x \otimes y$.
In Kademlia each node has a (unique) ID of 160-bit and maintains a
series of lists (one for each $i$ in $0 \leq i < 160$) of
$\langle \verb|IP-Address|, \verb|UDP-Port|, \verb|Node ID| \rangle$ triples.
Each list contains contacts for nodes of distance between $2^i$ and $2^{i+1}$
from the node's ID.
Each list can contain at most $k$ elements and is therefore known as
\textit{$k$-bucket}.
Each bucket is sorted by the time last
seen: in the head we find the least-recently seen node and at the end the most
recently ones.
When a node $R$ receives a message from a sender $S$, $R$ checks if the
$k$-bucket corresponding to the sender's ID (SID) already contains SID.
If it is the case SID is moved at the end of the list. Otherwise we should
distinguish two cases depending on whether the k-bucket is full or not.
In the former case $R$ pings the head ($H$) of the $k$-bucket and if
this responds, $S$ is discarded and $H$ is put at the end of the list,
otherwise $H$ is evicted and SID is inserted at the end of the list.
In the latter case the SID is simply inserted at the end of the list.
The rationale to prefer already known contacts to the new ones discovered
is due to the observation that the more a node has been on-line the more
likely it is to remain up another hour~\cite{bib:kademlia}.

% Description of the PROTOCOL's functions
The original Kademlia protocol is based on four RPC functions:
\verb|PING|, \verb|FIND_NODE|,
\verb|STORE| and \verb|FIND_VALUE| and their replies.
In Kademlia \verb|STORE| and \verb|FIND_VALUE| are used to save a
$\langle key, value\rangle$ pair in the DHT and later retrieve it, respectively.
Since these features are not needed for a pure node discovery, they
are not implemented in the Ethereum variant.
In this version there are only the \verb|PING| RPC, which is used to 
check whether a
node is still on-line or not and the \verb|FIND_NODE(ID)| call that is used to
retrieve the $k$ neighbors closest to the target \verb|ID|, known by the
recipient of the message. In the RLPx specification we can find also
the \verb|PONG| and \verb|NEIGHBORS| instructions that are the reply messages
for \verb|PING| and \verb|FIND_NODE|, respectively.
Apart from the missing functions RLPx has other important differences
from Kademlia:
the IDs are $512$ bit long, the XOR distance metric is done on the sha3
(Keccak-256) of the IDs (that is $256$ bit long) and not on the IDs and
finally the packets are signed and the public key corresponds to the ID.

In order to join the network for the first time a new node should
generate a new key pair
\footnote{The public key is the ID and the private key is used to sign the packets}, and
know the address of at least one participant.
In Ethereum this task is resolved by hard-coding the contact information
of some \textit{bootstrap nodes} in the client's code.
The aim of these nodes is to provide to new nodes, contact information to
other regular nodes that are already participating in the network.

RLPx uses its own URL scheme, \emph{enode}.
In this scheme are specified the ID of the node encoded in hexadecimal format,
the IP-Address and the TCP-Port of the node:
\begin{verbatim}
enode://<hexadecimal-node-id>@<IP>:<TCP-Port>[?discport:<UDP-PORT>]
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|discport| part is optional and is required only if the
UDP port (discovery port) does not correspond to the TCP one.
The default discovery UDP port is 30303.
