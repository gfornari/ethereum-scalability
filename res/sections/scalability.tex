\section{Scalability}
\label{sec:scalability}
The aim of this section is to study the scalability of Ethereum. Although the
scalability of blockchain, and of Ethereum in particular, is a well-known
problem and a major concern in the respective communities, in the literature
there are a limited number of \emph{scientific papers} that address this
problem. We give a little survey in \autoref{sec:background}. Next, we define
the Ethereum scalability with regards to the three axis of the Scale
Cube~\cite{bib:art-of-scalability}. We proceed first defining some metrics
useful to understand the Ethereum scalability, then measuring them in a test
environment.
