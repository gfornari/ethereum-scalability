\section{Scalability}
\label{sec:scalability}
The aim of this section is to study the scalability of Ethereum.
Although the scalability of blockchain, and of Ethereum in particular, is a
well-known problem and a major concern in the respective communities, in the
literature there are a limited number of \emph{scientific papers} that
addresses this problem.
We give a little survey in \autoref{sec:background}.

In the remainder of the Section we will analyze the scalability of Ethereum by
keeping into consideration the 3 axes of the cube of the
scalability~\cite{bib:art-of-scalability}.


\subsection{Background}

In this Section firstly, we point out the usual concerns about blockchain
technology and in particular Bitcoin and finally we analyze the related works
regarding Ethereum.

\paragraph{Bitcoin} 
One major concern about Bitcoin and all permissionless cryptocurrencies
in general is the limited \textbf{transaction
throughput}~\cite{bib:blockchain-challenges-opportunites-survey, bib:taxonomy}.
Thus, not all transactions emitted can be processed in a
predictable and bounded
time\footnote{\url{https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size}}.
Indeed, since the choice of the transactions
to include in the blockchain depends on the will of the miners,
it is more likely that the more profitable transactions are included
in the distributed
ledger~\cite{bib:blockchain-challenges-opportunites-survey,wood2018ethereum}.

The limited transaction throughput is due~\cite{bib:ghost} on the one hand to
the $1$ MB \textbf{maximal block size} and on the other
hand to the $10$ minutes \textbf{block interval}.

Increasing the former would certainly augment the transaction throughput and
decrease the transaction fees, but it would also slow down the propagation
time, thus increasing the possibility of forks. 
Decreasing the latter would increase the transaction throughput and increase
also the possibility of forks.
To address these bottlenecks Bitcoin cash and Litecoin
took place. The first is a hard fork of Bitcoin in which 
the blocks have a maximum size limit of $8$ MB and the
latter uses a block interval of $2.5$ minutes.
The increase in the number of forks reduce the security of the whole 
system~\cite{bib:ghost}.


Moreover, a number of confirmation blocks are
needed to be sure that the transactions are really 
confirmed~\cite{bib:taxonomy}, i.e. it is unlikely that the block in which
they are included can be discarded in favor of other blocks.
This uncertainty in the acceptance of a block is also known as
\textbf{lack of Consensus Finality}~\cite{bib:the-quest} and is due to the
probabilistic nature of the PoW consensus algorithm.
In Bitcoin the 
confirmation number is 6 blocks~\cite{bib:masteringbitcoin} that corresponds 
roughly to an hour.

Finally, another concern with this technology is the need to \textbf{store} an
increasingly large amount of data to keep the desired security guarantees.
 
\paragraph{Ethereum} Vukoli\'c~\cite{bib:the-quest} states that the introduction
of smart-contracts 
in Ethereum make the problem very similar to database replication and in 
particular \emph{state machine replication}. Also Wood~\cite{wood2018ethereum}
argue that it is very difficult to reach a high degree of scalability by
parallelizing transactions in this system because it is essentially a state
transaction machine.
Indeed the state in Ethereum influence the smart contract execution and
therefore the majority of transactions are dependent from previous ones, thus
making Ethereum \textbf{stateful}.


%*** et al. \cite{bib:sok:ethereum} individuate that scalability of blockchain
%is concerned with two major objectives: on the one hand increasing the
%transaction throughput and on the other hand
%decreasing the storage and bandwidth usage.
