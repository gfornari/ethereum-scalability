\section{Scalability}
\label{sec:scalability}

The aim of this section is to study the scalability of Ethereum. Although the
scalability of permission-less blockchain, and of Ethereum in particular, is a
well-known problem and a major concern in the respective communities as we
present in \autoref{sec:to-scale-or-not}, in the literature there are a limited
number of scientific papers that address this problem. We give a little survey
in \autoref{sec:background}. Next, we discuss the Ethereum scalability with
regards to the three axis of the Scale Cube~\cite{bib:art-of-scalability}. For
each axis, first we give a brief description, then we provide a virtuous
example of an architecture which scales on the axis, hence we conclude with an
analysis of the current status of Ethereum and some of the proposals coming
from the community to improve the scalability with respect to the inspected
axis.
