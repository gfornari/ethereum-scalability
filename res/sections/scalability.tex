\section{Scalability}
\label{sec:scalability}
The aim of this section is to study the scalability of Ethereum.
Although the scalability of blockchain, and of Ethereum in particular, is a
well-known problem and a major concern in the respective communities, in the
literature there are a limited number of \emph{scientific papers} that
address this problem.
We give a little survey in \autoref{sec:background}.

In the remainder of this section we will analyze the
scalability of Ethereum by
keeping into consideration the 3 axes of the cube of the
scalability~\cite{bib:art-of-scalability}.


\subsection{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this Section firstly, we point out the usual concerns about blockchain
technology and in particular Bitcoin and finally we analyze the related works
regarding Ethereum.

\paragraph{Bitcoin} 
One major concern about Bitcoin and all permissionless cryptocurrencies
in general is the limited \textbf{maximum transaction
throughput}~\cite{bib:blockchain-challenges-opportunites-survey, bib:taxonomy,
bib:scaling-croman}.
Thus, if the usage of this payment system augments,
not all transactions emitted can be processed
in a predictable and bounded
time\footnote{\url{https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size}}.
Moreover, the choice of the transactions
to include in the blockchain depends on the will of the miners.
Therefore it is more likely that the more profitable transactions are included
in the distributed
ledger~\cite{bib:blockchain-challenges-opportunites-survey,wood2018ethereum}.

The maximum limited transaction throughput is
due~\cite{bib:ghost, bib:scaling-croman} on the one
hand to the $1$ MB \textbf{maximal block size} and on the other
hand to the $10$ minutes \textbf{block interval}.

Increasing the former would certainly augment the transaction throughput and
decrease the transaction fees, but it would also slow down the propagation
time, thus increasing the possibility of forks. 
Decreasing the latter would increase the transaction throughput and increase
also the possibility of forks.
The increase in the number of forks reduces the security of the whole 
system~\cite{bib:ghost}.
To address these bottlenecks multiple solutions were
proposed. The blockchain system Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin try to agument
the maximal transaction throughput by modifying the bitcoin client to
have a maximum block size of $8$ MB and to have a block interval of $2.5$
minutes, respectively. The GHOST~\cite{bib:ghost} protocol consider also
the stale blocks to permit to diminish the block interval while preserving
the same security guarantees of the original proof of work, as we already
described in \autoref{sec:consensus:algorithm}.


In addition to these considerations a number of confirmation blocks are
needed to be sure that the transactions are really 
confirmed~\cite{bib:taxonomy}, i.e. it is unlikely that the block in which
they are included can be discarded in favor of other blocks.
This uncertainty in the acceptance of a block is also known as
\textbf{lack of Consensus Finality}~\cite{bib:the-quest} and is due to the
probabilistic nature of the PoW consensus algorithm.
Currently, in Bitcoin, to be sure that a block cannot be replaced by another
one, the confirmation of 6 blocks are needed~\cite{bib:masteringbitcoin}.
This corresponds roughly to an hour.


Another concern with this technology is the need to \textbf{store} an
increasingly large amount of data to keep the desired security guarantees.

Other major concerns are related to the \textbf{cost} of the system, especially
the cost per confirmed transaction~\cite{bib:scaling-croman} that is due
to the mining cost, the transactionm validation, the bandwidth and the
storage.

Finally, the bootstrap time~\cite{bib:scaling-croman}, that is, the time
needed for a new node to download and process the whole transaction history
is another key factor that can contribute to the scalability of the
system~\cite{bib:scaling-croman}.

 
\paragraph{Ethereum} Vukoli\'c~\cite{bib:the-quest} states that the introduction
of smart-contracts 
in Ethereum make the problem very similar to database replication and in 
particular \emph{state machine replication}. Also Wood~\cite{wood2018ethereum}
argue that it is very difficult to reach a high degree of scalability by
parallelizing transactions in this system because it is essentially a state
transaction machine.
Indeed the state in Ethereum influence the smart contract execution and
therefore the majority of transactions are dependent from previous ones, thus
making Ethereum \textbf{stateful}.


%*** et al. \cite{bib:sok:ethereum} individuate that scalability of blockchain
%is concerned with two major objectives: on the one hand increasing the
%transaction throughput and on the other hand
%decreasing the storage and bandwidth usage.
