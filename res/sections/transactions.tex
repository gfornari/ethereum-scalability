\subsection{Messages and transactions}

As we said in \autoref{sec:accounts}, the accounts can send messages or
transactions to other accounts depending on the account's type.

A transaction is a single instruction constructed by an actor externally to the
scope of Ethereum \cite{wood2018ethereum}, it is serialized and included in the
blockchain. It can be used to transfer ether\footnote{The currency used within
Ethereum} or to trigger contract code. A transaction represents a message call
or the creation of a new account with associated EVM Code.

A message is a virtual object that is not serialized and exists only in the
Ethereum execution environment. A message between two contract accounts is also
called \emph{internal transaction}, because of its dual nature of being
structured as a transaction and of being managed internally of the Ethereum
execution environment.

The structure of transactions and messages differs on two fields:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+init+, an unlimited size byte array specifying the EVM Code in a
  contract creation transaction
  \item \verb+data+, an unlimited size byte array specifying input data for the
  message call
\end{itemize}

\autoref{fig:messages-to-from-contract} shows the message call with regard to a
contract account. If the destination account is a contract, the message triggers
the execution of its code (\autoref{fig:messages-to-contract}). Instead, if the
message sender is a contract, the message is the result of the code execution
(\autoref{fig:messages-from-contract}).
