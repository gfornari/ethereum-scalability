\subsection{Messages and transactions}

As we said in \autoref{sec:accounts}, contracts can send messages or
transactions to other contracts in response to an event. A transaction is a
single instruction constructed by an actor externally to the scope of Ethereum
\cite{wood2018ethereum}, it is serialized and included in the blockchain. It can
be used to transfer ether\footnote{The currency used within Ethereum} or to
trigger contract code. A message is a virtual object that is not serialized and
exists only in the Ethereum execution environment.
