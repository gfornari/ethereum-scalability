\subsubsection{X-Axis: Horizontal Duplication}

The x-axis of the cube of the scalability is concerned with the horizontal
duplication and cloning with absolutely no bias, running each identical copy of
the system on a different server. Usually, the work is distributed by a load
balancer.

Reasoning on the x-axis is typically easy and the implementation can be fast,
but the data sets have to be replicated in their entirety which increases
operational costs.
