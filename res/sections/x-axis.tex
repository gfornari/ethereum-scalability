\subsection{X-Axis - Horizontal Duplication}

The x-axis of the cube of the scalability is concerned with the horizontal
duplication, i.e. cloning of the system~\cite{bib:art-of-scalability} on 
multiple machines.
In particular, given multiple equal machines the requests are sent to only one
of the machine. Usually, the work is distributed by a work balancer.
