\subsection{Consensus Algorithm}
\label{sec:consensus}

Essentially, the aim of the blockchain technology
is to provide a \textbf{total order to transactions} in a distributed
ledger~\cite{bib:the-quest} without relying on a trusted third party.
This permits to solve the double spending problem~\cite{bib:bitcoin}.
Moreover in Ethereum the order of transactions can also affects the execution
of smart contract by altering the storage.

Thus, finding an agreement on the order of transaction (i.e., the actual
blockchain) is crucial.
In Ethereum the agreement is reached by:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Accepting only valid blocks;
	\item Keeping the chain in which more work was performed, when two valid
	chains are encountered.
\end{enumerate}
