\section{Solidity}
\label{sec:solidity}
Solidity~\cite{bib:solidity-docs} is the most popular
high-level language used in the Ethereum ecosystem.
It is a high-level statically typed language that is compiled to EVM bytecode.
It takes inspiration from various languages, such as JavaScript, Python and C++.

In addition to the usual mathematical and logical operations, Solidity has
several peculiar variables and functions that resides on the global scope and
allow the programs to access the data shown in \autoref{fig:evm}.
One of this specially crafted global variables is the \texttt{msg} variable,
that allows the programs to access the message call data,
such as the code invoker's address (\texttt{msg.sender}) and the amount of
money sent along with the invocation (\texttt{msg.value}).

In order to provide an intuitive insight about Solidity, we provide a little
example in \autoref{listing:example}, that shows some key features of Solidity.

As it is easy to see, the contracts are the building blocks of the language and
resemble objects. Indeed, in Solidity one contract can also inherit from other
contracts.
The fields of the contract are stored in the contract's storage. In the example
there are two persistent variables \verb|x| and \verb|owner|. While the former
is marked as public the latter is marked as private. Thus, the compiler
creates a getter \verb|x()| for variable \verb|x| but not for variable
\verb|owner|. It should be noticed that the \verb|owner| variable can still
be read from outside the EVM\footnote{It is part of the contract's storage,
which in turn is part of the world state that is replicated in each node.},
but it cannot be read from other contracts that run on the EVM.


After the definition of the field variables we can see the \texttt{constructor}
method. It is run only once upon creation and returns the code of the contract
as we described in~\autoref{sec:contract-creation}. If it is not defined
an empty constructor is assumed.

The \emph{events} are a high-level interface for the EVM's logging
facilities. Events are emitted by smart contracts to notify external
applications, that can listen to them to perform some application-specific
operations. Logs are visible from the outside because they are stored
in the blockchain as part of the receipt of the transaction which emitted them.

After the definition of the events, the \emph{modifier} \verb|onlyOwner| is
defined. A modifier is a piece of code that is executed before or after the
call of a function decorated with it. They can be used to implement final
state machines~\cite{bib:solidity-docs} and pre- and post-conditions checks for
functions.

The \emph{functions} are an abstraction of the language. They can be invoked
either \texttt{internally}, that is inside the same call stack activation record
with a \texttt{JUMP} or \texttt{JUMPI} instruction or \texttt{externally}, that
is by creating a new message call. In the former case the machine state is the
same of the invoker, while in the latter the code is executed in a new machine
state, that is, by creating a new activation record on the call stack, as
discussed in \autoref{sec:evm}. The first 4 bytes of the hash of the signature
of external function (function name and parameter types) is used as unique
identifier (\emph{selector}) of a function. When an actor wants to invoke a
function externally it should provide the function's selector in the message
data and follow the ABI format~\cite{bib:solidity-docs}. Essentially, the
Solidity compiler puts at the start of the compiled code a switch-statement that
checks if the first four bytes of the message call data match a known function's
selector. If it is the case the program jumps to the definition of the matched
function otherwise a so-called fallback function is invoked. The programmer may
specify the fallback function by writing an unnamed function that does not take
parameters. Since the signature depends on the number and the type of arguments,
function overloading is easily implemented by using the new obtained selector.

Moreover, we distinguish also between \texttt{public} and \texttt{private}
functions. The formers can be called either externally or internally, while the
latters can be called only internally and are not visible to the contracts that
are below in the inheritance hierarchy.

In addition to the visibility, the function header may contain a state
mutability flag: we distinguish between \texttt{pure}, \texttt{view} and
\texttt{payable}. The first indicates that the function will not access the
state, the second promises to access the state in a read-only fashion while the
latter indicates that the function is capable of receiving money.
Pure and view functions can be invoked also from outside the EVM, i.e. without
a transaction and without paying fees. After all, the function reads only the
local state without the intervention of the other peers.
Obviously, if these types of functions are called with a transaction or during
the execution of another contract, the normal gas consumption applies, because
all the full nodes should execute the code.
